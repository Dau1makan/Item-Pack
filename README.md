        <p>This mod adds new items to Baldur's Gate II, Tutu, BGT and Planescape:Torment, as well as plenty of item-related tweaks that I find convenient.</p>

<p>Before installing this mod, or any other, make sure you have done a proper backup, in order to avoid the hassles of installing/uninstalling the entire game and make your life easier if you run across any problems. If you don't know how to properly do this, check this wonderful thread:
  </p><blockquote>
    <a href="http://forums.pocketplane.net/index.php/topic,17555.0.html">Building and Maintaining a Clean Install</a>
  </blockquote>

  Once that is done, just extract the contents of this mod to your BGII folder (if you’re installing on a Tutu/BGT game, point to the Tutu/BGT folder instead), make sure you haven't got any Infinity Engine applications such as Shadow Keeper or Infinity Explorer open, and run the Setup-Item_Pack.exe. You'll be asked what do with each component (all of them are optional).
<p></p>

<h2 id="Compatibility">I. Compatibility</h2>

<p>This is a <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU</a> mod, so it should work well along with such others. If you have other item-affecting mods, be warned that <b>Components 3. &amp; 4.</b> from 
  this mod overwrite items, so you'll only get to see their version or mine of the items in question, depending on your install order. <b>From version 2.0 onwards, the mod is fully compatible with both BG1&2 Enhanced Editions (Planescape:Torment component is untested on PST:EE)</b>.

</p><p>

  Some of the items provide spell-like abilities. These are taken from the vanilla game's spells, so if you have <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/spells/spell_rev">Spell Revisions</a> installed or any 
  similar spell mod, said changes will be accounted for. In other words, <b>Item Pack</b> will use, when appropriate, any modified version of spells you have, provided it's installed <u>AFTER</u> them (there's only
   one exception, which should be obvious enough by the item's description). 
  
   </p><p>

  In order to see all the items, you should install Item Pack AFTER the following:
  </p><blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Tactics' Gebhard Blucher's Improved Mae'Var</li>
      <li>Item Upgrade</li>
      <li>Anishai One Day NPC</li>
      <li>Questpack's Additional Shadow Thieves' Content</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  Note that <u>those aren’t necessary</u> for <b>Item Pack</b> to work. But if you want them, they should be installed before. <p></p>
 
  <p>  You'll have to start a new game in order to enjoy the full contents of this mod. 
  </p>

  <br>
<h2 id="Components">II. Components</h2>

<a name="Main Component" id="Main Component"></a>
<h3>1. Item Pack v2.1</h3>

  This is the mod's main component. It will add <b>45</b> brand new items to the game, with some of them taken from the Icewind Dale series &amp; Planescape: Torment, although modified in several cases. The items themselves are 
  dispersed throughout the game: some of them can be bought in stores, others will be in possession of enemies or other NPCs. In two particular instances, two of the new items will replace vanilla ones as quest 
  rewards (don't worry, you can still get those somewhere else). <br>
  Cespenar will forge a new item for you as well.
<p></p>

<p>
  There are two spoiler files included with the mod with the abilities for each item and their exact location if you're curious, though I recommend not using them on the first playthrough.
  </p>

  <a name="Extra Items" id="Extra Items"></a>
  <h3>2. Extra Items</h3>
<p>

  Adds a pair of <i>Boots of Speed</i> and a <i>Potion Case</i> to Ribald, a <i>Bag of Holding</i> to one of the containers near the Jailkeep Golem in Chateau Irenicus, the <i>Cloak of Balduran</i> to one of the 
  chests in Irenicus' room, an extra <i>chunk of Illithium</i> to Neb so you can upgrade the <i>Mace of Disruption</i> and complete Sir Sarles' quest at the same time, and 5 extra tokens for the slot machine in 
  Spellhold.
</p>

<a name="Tweaked Items" id="Tweaked Items"></a>
<h3>3. Tweaked Items</h3>
<p>This component will tweak several items so that: 
  </p><ul id="tweaked">
    <li>The <i>Greenstone</i> is changed to provide its immunity effects simply by being equipped</li>
    <li>The same goes for the <i>Shield Amulet</i></li>
    <li>The <i>Darksteel Shield</i>'s resistance to Poison is changed to resistance to Electricity</li>
    <li>The <i>Scarlet Ninja-to</i> will now be equippable by fighter classes (except Beastmaster) and thieves</li>
    <li>The <i>Studded Leather of Thorns +6</i> will now inflict 3D4 points of Fire damage (instead of just 1D4) and provide a small measure of Fire resistance (+25%)</li>
    <li>The upgraded <i>Short Sword of Mask</i> has double chance (30%) of triggering both of its special abilities</li>
    <li>The <i>Ring of Protection - Warder's Signet</i> is now of +5 enchantment (which is the P&amp;P maximum) and gets a new BAM as well</li>
    <li>The <i>Staff of Arundel</i> now provides +2 AC bonus, 30% resistance to Fire/Cold (instead of just 10%), and bonus spells are replaced with a once/day cast of Iron Skins</li>
    <li>The <i>Mercykiller Ring</i> will now add a +1 bonus to Backstab multiplier in addition to its vanilla abilities and also gets a new BAM</li>
    <li>The <i>Rod of Smiting</i> is usable by all classes</li>
    <li>The <i>Club of Detonation +5</i> will now trigger a party friendly Fireball upon 15% of all successful hits. Unfinished Business' expanded item description for it is included</li>
    <li>The <i>Harbinger Sword</i> will trigger a friendly Fireball as well</li>
    <li>The <i>Girdle of Fortitude</i> is changed to set Constitution to 18 by being equipped instead of once/day</li>
    <li>The <i>Cloak of the Stars</i> will convey a +1 THAC0 bonus while equipped, as well as SET mastery in Darts</li>
    <li><i>Malla's Soul Stone</i>'s cast of Neutralize Poison is replaced by plain immunity to Poison and Disease, as well as providing +1 Strength and +1 AC in addition to its other stat bonuses</li>
    <li><i>Jerrod's Mace</i> will now provide immunity to Poison and Bleeding effects while equipped</li>
    <li>The <i>Shakti Figurine</i> has twice the duration (8 rounds) and sets mastery in Short Sword instead of just specialization.</li>
    <li>The <i>Storm Star +5</i> mace provides 50% resistance to Electricity (instead of just 20%) and has a 15% chance of triggering a Chain Lightning (instead of 5%).</li>
    </ul>  
In all cases the item descriptions are updated to reflect the changes. <p></p>

<p>If installed on Tutu, the <i>Greenstone</i> and the <i>Shield Amulet</i> will be affected in the BG1 portion of the game too.
</p>

<a name="Convenient Free Action Items" id="Convenient Free Action Items"></a>
<h3>4. Convenient Free Action Items</h3>
<p>This will change the <i>Flail of Ages</i>, <i>Ixil's Spike</i>, and the <i>Ring of Free Action</i> so that they no longer prevent the wielder from being hasted (they will still provide protection against hold, slow, and other similar effects).</p>
	
<p>If installed on Tutu, the <i>Ring of Free Action</i> will be affected in the BG1 portion of the game too.</p>


<a name="More Distinguishable Items" id="More Distinguishable Items"></a>
<h3>5. More Distinguishable Items</h3>
<p>This component will change the inventory BAMs for the <i>Ring of Regeneration</i>, the <i>Girdle of Fortitude</i>, the <i>Saving Grace</i> shield, the <i>Defender of Easthaven</i> flail, the <i>Robe of Vecna</i>, 
<i>Dak'kon's Katana</i>, the <i>Sensate Amulet</i>, <i>Vhailor’s Helm</i>, the <i>Skull of the Lich</i>, the <i>Mercykiller Ring</i>, the <i>Plate of Balduran</i>, <i>Edwin’s Amulet</i>, the <i>Scarlet Ninja-To</i>, <i>Everard’s Morning Star</i>, 
  <i>Everard’s Sling</i>, <i>Jerrod’s Mace</i>, <i>Mauler’s Arm</i>, <i>The Sleeper</i>, <i>Malla’s Soul Stone</i>, and <i>Wong Fei’s Ioun Stone</i>. Previously, all of them shared BAMs with other existing items. They should all stand out now. 
</p>
  <p>  A new Werewolf paperdoll for the Shapeshifter class is included as well. </p>


  <a name="Familiar Faces" id="Familiar Faces"></a>
  <h3>6. Familiar Faces</h3>
<p>This will make Joluv and Deidre appear in Amkethran's Inn, in case you forgot to buy something or didn't have enough funds while in SoA.</p>

<a name="More Work for Cromwell" id="More Work for Cromwell"></a>
<h3>7. More Work for Cromwell</h3>

<p>This component will allow Cromwell to forge more items for you. The list of recipes is as follows (highlight to see the components required):</p>

</tbody></table></center>


<a name="Pocket Store" id="Pocket Store"></a>
<h3>8. Pocket Store</h3>
	
<p>This component will enable a new vendor in the pocket plane, mainly for dumping stuff purposes, though he has 2 new items for sale as well (these are not included in the main component). In order for him to appear, you need to have rescued (killed) Dola Fadoon, the genie being tortured near the entrance of Ust Natha. If you talk to him after the destruction of Saradush, he will help you a bit with your upgrade components (you can get another copy of either the <i>Heart of the Damned</i>, the <i>Bowstring of Gond</i>, or the <i>Eye of Tyr</i>, just once).</p>
	

<a name="Item Pack for Tutu/BGT" id="Item Pack for Tutu/BGT"></a>
<h3>9. Item Pack for Tutu/BGT</h3>

<p>Adds a small amount of the main component's items to the BG1 part of the game. The items added are (highlight to read): </p><div id="reqs"><i>Black Wolf Amulet, Gauntlets of Elven Might, Helm of the Trusted Defender, Blur Deck, Jester's Bag of Holding, Serpent's Ring, Clasp of Bron's Cloak, Ring of Dwarven Bone, Holy Chaos! Deck, Oil of Second Chances, Mummy's Tea, Boots of the Forgotten Ones, and the Tome of Sacred Verse.</i></div><br>Furthermore, a <i>Bag of Holding</i> is added to Winthrop's shop, two scrolls of Knock are added to the Priests' Quarters in Candlekeep, as well as new BAMs for <i>Perdue's Sword</i>, <i>Edwin's Amulet</i>, <i>History of the Sisters of Light and Darkness</i>, and the <i>Vial of Mysterious Liquid</i>. There's also a new item exclusive to the BG1 part of the game: <i>Ulcaster Academy Ring</i>, which is added to the <i>The Vampire Sword</i> as a reward for giving Ulcaster the <i>Idol of Koza</i> and the <i>Ancient Armor</i>.<p></p>  
	
<p>As with the main component, there's a spoiler file with their exact locations inside the mod's directory.</p>

<a name="Elemental Damage" id="Elemental Damage"></a>
<h3>10. +X% Elemental Damage</h3>
<p>Making use of Ascension64’s ToBEx magic, this component will add 5 new items with the +X% Elemental Damage ability. There’s one item for each “element” (acid, cold, fire, electricity, and magic), and each of them
   will increase their respective element’s damage by 20%. This component is based on (and requires) ToBEx Beta0021_test_110709 or greater. 
   <br>If playing BG2:EE or EE:T, whis component will be unavailable and instead the items will be included with the main component.</p>

<p>There’s a spoiler file with the items’ locations inside the mod’s directory as well.</p>

<a name="Planescape Torment" id="Planescape Torment"></a>
<h3>11. Item Pack for Planescape:Torment</h3>
<p>Unlike the previous ones, this component modifies the items by patching, although since modding for PS:T is so scarce, it hardly matters. I made this with all of 
  <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/551-planescape-torment-mods">Qwinn's excellent mods</a> installed, so no need to worry about compatibility with those. All modified items 
  have their descriptions updated as well.</p>

  <p>This component makes the following changes:

</p><ul>
  <li>The following items are now stackable: <i>Minor &amp; Greater Dustman Embalming Charms</i>, <i>Mirrors of Imaging</i>, <i>Rods of Mordron Might</i>, <i>Notched daggers</i>, <i>Phantom daggers</i>, <i>Abyssal Pipes</i></li>
  <li>Emoric's store now has an infinite stack of both <i>Embalming Charms</i></li>
  <li><i>Assassin's Knuckles</i> and <i>Club of Nettles</i> are now usable by Annah</li>
  <li><i>Magus' Guard</i> is now usable by everyone (save for Morte &amp; Nordom)</li>
  <li><i>Magus' Shield</i> is now usable by everyone (save for Morte &amp; Nordom)</li>
  <li>Included a detailed description for the <i>Axe of the Jester</i>'s effects</li>
  <li>Restored the previously unavailable <i>Indep Earring</i>. Only usable by Annah, this earring is now added to Quint's shop in the Buried Village</li>
  <li>Added the previously unavailable <i>Lower Planes' Vermin Armor</i>. Only usable by Annah, it's added to Crumplecrunch's store. As the item had no special properties, I've also taken the liberty to add 
    bonuses according to what an armor upgrade for Annah would be at that point in the game: AC 2, +2 THAC0, +25% Pick Pocket Skill Bonus, +35% Stealth Skill Bonus</li>
  <li>Added new BAMs for <i>Gehraise's Ring</i>, <i>Gorgon Salve</i>, <i>Kaarlac's Knife</i>, and <i>Tear of Salieru-Dei</i></li>
<li><i>Adahn's Dagger</i>: raised its Enchantment level to +3 and doubled its selling price</li>
<li><i>Ascension</i>: raised its Enchantment level to +3</li>
<li><i>Butcherer of Innocents</i>: raised its Enchantment level to +3</li>
<li><i>Celestial Fire</i>: increased AC bonus from +2 to +3 and THAC0 bonus from +2 to +3 to match Enchantment Level, increased relevant physical resistance from +10% to +15%</li>
<li><i>Enlightment</i>: raised its Enchantment level to +3</li>
<li><i>Eye of Vecna</i>: changed -3 INT penalty into a +3 bonus (why would a lich archmage's eye REDUCE Intelligence?? Probably to balance the extra spells, which are mostly useless anyway because practically every 
  enemy has magic resistance. Now it's actually useful as it befits an item of its magnitude)	</li>
<li><i>Ogre Gauntlets</i>: made them a miscellaneous item that grants 19 STR instead of a weapon, also extended usability to all non-mages</li>
<li><i>Reason</i>: raised its Enchantment level to +3</li>
<li><i>Dhall's Quill</i>: increased its +1 permanent Lore bonus to +10</li>
<li><i>Xacharia's Liver</i>: before it was merely flavor junk, now it's a one-time use item that provides a permanent +1 bonus to ranged weapons and damage (only usable by Nordom)</li>
  <li>Included a detailed description for the <i>Number of Ku'u Yin</i></li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Annah</i>: raised thieving skills bonuses from +3% to +10%</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Devouring Vermin</i>: raised Acid Resistance bonus from +5% to +25%, raised saving throws VS. Poison bonus from +1 to +5</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Dreams of Es-Annon</i>: raised hit point bonus from +2 to +10, raised saving throws VS. Spell bonus from +1 to +2</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Enduring</i>: raised hit point bonus from +3 to +6</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Greater Enduring</i>: raised hit point bonus from +9 to +18</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Grosuk's Demise</i>, <i>Tattoo of the Black-Barbed Maze</i>, <i>Tattoo of the Restless Dead</i>, <i>Tattoo of Sebastion's End</i>, <i>Tattoo of the Anarchists</i>, <i>Tattoo of Spite</i>, and
<i>Tattoo of the Bonesinger</i> now have 33 charges each</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Ignus</i>: raised Constitution bonus from +1 to +2, raised hit point bonus from +3 to +10</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Tenement of Shadows</i>: raised Stealth bonus from +15% to +25%</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of the Master Thief</i>: raised thieving skills bonuses from +5% to +10%</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Silent Coins</i>: raised equipped Pickpocket bonus from +5% to +10%, raised permanent Pickpocket bonus from +3% to +5%</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of the Sensates</i>: raised Lore bonus from +3 to +10, Sensory Touch now has 33 charges</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of the Skull</i>: now adds 10% physical resistance</li>  
<li><i>Tattoo of the Tale-Weaver</i>: raised Lore bonus from +5 to +20</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of the Unbroken Circle</i>: raised Cold Resistance bonus from +10% to +35%</li>
<li><i>Tattoo of Trist's Savior</i>: raised save VS. Death bonus from +3 to +6</li>
  </ul>

<a name="Cursed Items" id="Cursed Items"></a>
<h3>12. Cursed Items</h3>
<p>IE veterans will know that cursed items suck, and that at best only careless first timers wil get to "use" them (and even then only once) as was originally intended. This component aims to remedy that, by adding benefits to the items so it's not all drawbacks, hopefully making them appealing enough to at least consider using them. You can check the ReadMe included with the mod for the full descriptions</p>
